pipeing to ec2 instance

## Things to keep in mind

### Tomcat
- Use bin tomcat
- Don't use src tomcat

### Personal health
- Drink water
- Infrequently take brakes per day

### Jenkins
- Sometimes linking jenkins to yourself, in slack, just doesn't work
- There are some credentials that take awhile to populate in drop-down
- Sometime you can't add credentials needed with add button
- You can get through this
